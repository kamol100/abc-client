## INVOICE-001 implementation

Partially implemented the invoice specification with 36 nonmutating Playwright checks across list, forms, documents, payments-dialog and access files. Added playwright.invoices.config.ts and npm run test:e2e:invoices; the existing all-suite runner discovers it automatically. Reused explicit CP/MK login/profile-verified in-memory auth without requesting the owned-client mutation fixture. Independent Zod resource schemas preserve invoice UUID identity under id and verify UI/API rows, relation dropdowns and rendered currency without importing production calculations as the oracle.

Coverage includes list/date/client/type/status/amount/reload, track/status/type/client/zone/creator/combined filters, actual pagination boundaries, UUID client history, no-match recovery, anonymous routes, selected bidirectional foreign UUID detail/search denial, invalid form recovery/defaults/cancel, unsaved lines/quantity totals, paid/partial field requirements, due edit hydration/cancel, oversized multibyte note rejection, document identity/lines/note/total, instrumented browser print/cleanup, delete cancellation and payment-dialog identities/select-all totals/cancel. No valid invoice create/update/delete/payment/discount, fund change or customer notification was submitted.

Final verification executed:
- E2E_INVOICE_ARTIFACT_DIR=/tmp/isp-invoices-cp npm run test:e2e:invoices: 36 passed, zero failed/skipped (about 1.3 minutes).
- E2E_TENANT=mk E2E_INVOICE_ARTIFACT_DIR=/tmp/isp-invoices-mk npm run test:e2e:invoices: 36 passed, zero failed/skipped (about 1.4 minutes).
- scripts/ai/typecheck: passed.
- npm test -- tests/unit/invoices: 12 files / 48 tests passed.
- npm run test:e2e -- --list: passed; 90 tests collected (clients 32, legacy 11, invoices 36, support tickets 11), no feature/legacy overlap. Full all-suite browser execution was not claimed; existing client mutation prerequisites remain.
- python3 tests/e2e/specifications/check_coverage.py: passed inventory/link/register validation; target remains unmet.
- scripts/ai/diff and scripts/ai/status inspected after edits.

Earlier runs caught and corrected test locator/assumption errors: dotted IDs rather than name attributes; untranslated static-option search keys; composite client dropdown labels; unlabeled delete trigger; missing creator field; single-page fixtures; payment button availability versus selection behavior. Superseded failures are not application defects. Final reports remain in /tmp/isp-invoices-{cp,mk}/results.json with sanitized exact titles/timestamps/source hashes in tests/e2e/specifications/invoices/EXECUTION.json.

Updated invoice README/spec/IMPLEMENTATION.md and register/inventory with 19 partially implemented parents. All other invoice parents retain explicit policy/fixture/implementation blockers. No complete parent scenario was credited passing; review remains pending. Financial arithmetic/allocation/concurrency/discount rules require the parent ticket decisions, disposable owned invoices, fake external integrations, independent fund/payment/client-balance checks and restricted personas. Current single-page datasets do not execute the multi-page branch. Creator filtering proves UI/API agreement only because InvoiceResource omits creator identity.

Source findings: InvoiceResource returns UUID under id while production row schema declares numeric id. View passes invoice.uuid, preventing lazy detail hydration for id-only resources; rendered fallback content was checked independently, but no hydration freshness coverage is claimed. Discount/due authorization questions from the ticket remain unverified source observations. Ordinary company tests never substitute platform administration. Known foreign invoice read denials do not prove reseller/zone or mutation isolation; no writable company_id/reseller_id was added. API remains the security boundary.

Existing login-form/auth helper/integration/session, opencode.json, client suite/config/specification, support-ticket suite/config/specification and prior runner work were preserved. This task adds only invoice suite/config, its npm script, its documentation/register entries and invoice guidance in tests/e2e/AGENTS.md. No dependencies installed, production settings edited, commits/push/deploy or backend mutations performed. Earlier task reports follow.

## Diagnosis: four isolated client failures

Inspected playwright-report/client-suite/results.json and the isolated fixture guard. All four clients-isolated tests failed with the same configuration error: Isolated client tests require E2E_CLIENT_MUTATIONS=1 and E2E_CLIENT_FIXTURE_FILE; no live router/customer mutations permitted. These failures do not establish a client UI defect: the tests stopped at their prerequisite guard before their create/edit actions.

Required setup is a disposable database, fake router/notification adapters, and a real tenant-owned network/package fixture JSON described in tests/e2e/clients/README.md. Both environment variables must reference that actual setup; setting attestations alone does not provision it. No guards changed, no tests skipped, no browser or mutation tests rerun. All-suite command remains inclusive as requested. Existing unrelated changes preserved. Ran scripts/ai/status and scripts/ai/diff; only this report changed during diagnosis.

## Correction: standard command includes every suite

User clarified npm run test:e2e must run all tests, including clients. This supersedes the prior client-only command decision below.

Added scripts/run-e2e.mjs, which discovers root-level playwright*.config.ts files, runs every suite sequentially with its own config/auth/report settings, continues after suite failure and exits nonzero if any suite fails. Standard test:e2e and test:e2e:ui use this runner; UI windows open sequentially. Focused suite scripts remain available. The legacy config now collects root-level specs only, preventing duplicate collection of client and support-ticket directories. Preserved existing legacy port/baseURL edits and new support-ticket work. Updated client README, agent instructions and initial guidelines. All client projects, including four guarded mutations, are included; absent fixtures fail explicitly.

Verification executed:
- npm run test:e2e -- --list: passed; collected 54 tests across three configs: clients 32 (28 nonmutating + four isolated), legacy 11, support tickets 11. No overlapping spec files.
- npm run test:e2e -- --list --grep '^E2E_RUNNER_NO_MATCH_SENTINEL$': intentionally returned exit 1 after all three suites reported no matching tests; proves continuation and aggregate failure without browser/database actions.
- node --check scripts/run-e2e.mjs: passed.
- scripts/ai/typecheck: passed.
- scripts/ai/diff and scripts/ai/status: inspected after edits.

Full browser execution was not repeated: isolated client mutation fixtures remain unavailable. This correction establishes full-suite selection and truthful failure reporting, not a claim that all 54 tests pass. Existing client CP/MK execution evidence remains below. No dependencies installed, no application changes or fixture guard weakening. Existing login-form/auth helper/integration/session, opencode.json and support-ticket changes were left intact.

## SUPPORT-001 Playwright coverage

Added `playwright.support-tickets.config.ts` and `tests/e2e/support-tickets` for the staff ticket list, create, conversation, and access scenarios that do not depend on an open review decision. Login uses CP and MK on their registered hosts, with credentials from the ignored tenant env and sessions kept in memory. `npm run test:e2e:tickets` runs this project. The default `npm run test:e2e` command is unchanged.

Owned tickets are created and deleted during the run. Creation writes in-app staff notifications. It does not send customer SMS. Review-blocked scenarios (ST-F08, ST-U01, ST-C06, ST-P05, ST-A02, ST-A04, ST-D01) were not implemented. Subscriber checks were not written because no subscriber credentials were supplied.

Command: `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/Library/Caches/ms-playwright E2E_TICKET_ARTIFACT_DIR=/tmp/isp-support-tickets npm run test:e2e:tickets`

Result at 2026-11-12T15:07:19Z on revision 64fcbb7: 10 passed, 1 failed, 26.5s. Evidence: `tests/e2e/specifications/support-tickets/EXECUTION.json` and `/tmp/isp-support-tickets/results.json`.

Passed: ST-L01, ST-L04, ST-F01, ST-F03, ST-C01, ST-C02, ST-C03, ST-A01, the ST-A03 read/search/open/reply/delete denial, and ST-A05. These stay `implemented` with pending review, so they are not passing coverage.

Failed: `ST-A03 a foreign client id cannot replace the ticket client`. A CP update with an MK client's numeric id removes the original visible client. `UpdateTicketRequest` accepts `client_id` without a company-scoped exists check. Cleanup writes the original client id back and deletes the ticket. The assertion was not weakened.

Empty subject on create currently shows the raw Zod text "Expected number, received nan" and prevents "Client is required" from appearing. ST-F03 therefore selects a subject and checks the client and message errors. Missing-subject behavior remains unasserted until review.

Specification checker passed. `scripts/ai/typecheck` is recorded after the fixture typing fix. No dependencies were installed. No application ticket code was changed.

Unrelated dirty files left in place: `components/login/login-form.tsx`, `playwright.config.ts`, `playwright/.auth/user.json`, `tests/e2e/auth-integration.spec.ts`, `tests/e2e/helpers/auth.ts`, `opencode.json`, and the existing client-suite files. Prior client-suite notes follow.

## Follow-up: standard Playwright command wiring

The reported 27 failures were collected under the legacy chromium project: npm run test:e2e previously invoked playwright test with the original config, which discovered client specs with the wrong base URL/setup and included isolated mutations without required fixture controls. The dedicated client config had passed independently but was not wired into the standard npm command.

Updated package.json so test:e2e, test:e2e:ui and test:e2e:clients select the nonmutating clients-chromium project. Added test:e2e:clients:isolated for guarded mutations and test:e2e:legacy for existing auth/vendor/zone tests. Added only the client exclusion to the already modified legacy config; preserved its preexisting port/baseURL edits. Updated client README and agent guidance. Default command currently covers the ready client project, not all features or legacy tests. No tests were deleted or weakened.

Verification: E2E_CLIENT_ARTIFACT_DIR=/tmp/isp-client-default-command npm run test:e2e passed 28 tests in 46.1 seconds against default CP. Report: /tmp/isp-client-default-command/results.json. Discovery checks selected 28 default checks, four isolated tests, and 11 legacy tests without overlap. scripts/ai/typecheck passed. Specification checker passed integrity checks; coverage target remains unmet. Isolated mutation and legacy tests were not executed in this follow-up. No dependencies installed. Unit tests were not repeated for script/config-only changes; previous failures remain recorded below.

Unrelated login-form, auth integration/helper, tracked auth-state and opencode.json changes were preserved. The preexisting default config changes were preserved alongside the explicit exclusion. Prior implementation details follow.

## Summary

Partially implemented CLIENT-001 in tests/e2e/clients with an independent tenant-aware playwright.clients.config.ts. Added explicit CP/MK credential loading, strict same-origin UI login and independent REST profile verification, host-specific in-memory sessions, independent transport contracts, owned-client setup/cleanup guards, and scenario IDs in test titles. Default Playwright config/global setup/auth helper and existing application changes were preserved.

28 nonmutating browser checks cover list/total/reload; name/PPPoE/phone search; status and billing filters; month deep link; empty results; detail links/name/package; phone/WhatsApp targets; missing fields and minimum name; create cancel/defaults; four anonymous route denials; and bidirectional CP/MK known foreign UUID read/search denial. Four isolated mutation tests cover UI create, edit/preserve billing, cancel edit and optional IP clearing; collected/typechecked but not executed without isolated fake-backed fixtures.

Added runner README, all-48-scenario IMPLEMENTATION.md and sanitized EXECUTION.json with exact test titles, run commands, timestamps and source hashes. Updated CLIENT-001/register/inventory and agent guidelines to identify the separate runner. No whole parent scenario was credited as passing from incomplete slices; 16 parents have implemented slices and 32 remain blocked/pending prerequisites. This is not full CLIENT-001 completion or >90% coverage.

## Executed checks

- scripts/ai/typecheck: passed after implementation.
- CP: client Chromium project: 28 passed; command/timestamp in EXECUTION.json. Raw report /tmp/isp-client-e2e-cp/results.json.
- MK: client Chromium project: 28 passed; command/timestamp in EXECUTION.json. Raw report /tmp/isp-client-e2e-mk/results.json.
- Isolated project --list: four tests collected; no mutation execution.
- scripts/ai/test: failed in ten unchanged unit-test files (date pickers, menu, column persistence, reseller-client list/filter, client dashboard info, pay, maps); no fixes to those files included.
- Specification checker: inventory, links, IDs and register integrity passed.
- Earlier browser runs exposed fixture schema/selector/hydration issues; corrected and superseded by final passing CP/MK runs. Shared report directory was cleared during verification, so final evidence uses isolated run-specific output folders.

## Findings / prerequisites

API returns numeric SID/payment_deadline whereas application schema expects strings; tests use independent transport schema without changing application code. Desktop filter trigger lacks an accessible name; tests identify its rendered funnel icon. Create bootstrap can lose early typed values/native-submit before asynchronous defaults settle, so helper waits at create bootstrap only. Next-SID hint is configured but not rendered by current shared field code; no passing hint coverage claimed.

Full mutation tests need disposable database and fake router/SMS/Telegram adapters, tenant-owned network/package fixture and cleanup permissions. Restricted staff/subscriber/reseller/zone accounts and controlled server errors were not supplied. Review-blocked billing/locking/deletion/image cases remain explicit. Asked for fixture location while continuing independent checks; no reply received. No valid client save, customer notification, payment or hardware mutation was executed.

Tenant A/B read denial was verified for selected known clients; this does not prove all API mutation paths or full tenant isolation. APP administration was not substituted for company personas.

## Existing changes left untouched

components/login/login-form.tsx, playwright.config.ts, playwright/.auth/user.json, tests/e2e/auth-integration.spec.ts, tests/e2e/helpers/auth.ts and untracked opencode.json. Existing feature workspaces preserved except CLIENT-001 status/register links and suite guidance. Updated this report as required.
